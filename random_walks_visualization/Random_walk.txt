I used Python to generate data for a random walk, and
then used Matplotlib to create a visually appealing representation of that
data.
A random walk is a path that has no clear direction but is determined
by a series of random decisions, each of which is left entirely to chance. You
might imagine a random walk as the path a confused ant would take if it
took every step in a random direction.

Random walks have practical applications in nature, physics, biology,
chemistry, and economics. For example, a pollen grain floating on a
drop of water moves across the surface of the water because itâ€™s constantly
pushed around by water molecules. Molecular motion in a water drop is
random, so the path a pollen grain traces on the surface is a random walk.
This code models many real-world situations.
